# 🎓📚 Hibernate Many-to-Many Relationship  
## Student & Course Example

This project demonstrates a **Many-to-Many relationship** using Hibernate (JPA) between **Student** and **Course** entities.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- One **Student** can enroll in multiple **Courses**
- One **Course** can have multiple **Students**
- A **join table** is used to maintain the relationship

---

## 🔹 Relationship Concept

Student (Many)  --------  (Many) Course

- Many Students ↔ Many Courses  
- Managed using a **Join Table**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java  
- Hibernate  
- JPA Annotations  
- MySQL  
- Maven  

---

## 🗄 Database Structure

### Student Table
- id (Primary Key)  
- name  
- email  

### Course Table
- id (Primary Key)  
- course_name  
- duration  

### Student_Course (Join Table)
- student_id (Foreign Key)  
- course_id (Foreign Key)  

---

## 🔁 Hibernate Mapping Concept

### Many-To-Many (Owning Side)

- Defined in one entity (e.g., Student)  
- Uses `@ManyToMany`  
- Uses `@JoinTable`  
- Specifies join columns and inverse join columns  

### Inverse Side

- Defined in the other entity (e.g., Course)  
- Uses `@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")`  
- Does not define JoinTable again  

---

## 🔑 Key Annotations Used

- `@Entity` → Marks class as entity  
- `@Table` → Maps entity to table  
- `@Id` → Primary key  
- `@GeneratedValue` → Auto ID generation  
- `@ManyToMany` → Defines many-to-many relationship  
- `@JoinTable` → Defines join table  
- `@JoinColumn` → Defines foreign key columns  

---

## ⚙ Fetch Strategies

- **EAGER** → Loads associated entities immediately  
- **LAZY** → Loads associated entities only when accessed  

(Default for ManyToMany is LAZY)

---

## 🔁 Cascade Behavior (If Applied)

- CascadeType.PERSIST → Saves related entities  
- CascadeType.MERGE → Updates related entities  
- CascadeType.REMOVE → Use carefully (may delete linked records)

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- A student can enroll in multiple courses  
- A course can contain multiple students  
- Join table maintains the relationship  
- Foreign keys ensure referential integrity  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project explains:

- Hibernate Many-to-Many mapping  
- Join table concept  
- Owning and inverse side  
- Fetch types (Lazy & Eager)  
- Cascade operations

⭐ This example helps understand complex relational mapping in real-world applications like learning management systems.
